Y Combinator (YC) is one of the most renowned startup accelerators globally. Founded in March 2005 by Paul Graham, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Trevor Blackwell, Y Combinator has played a pivotal role in fostering innovation and entrepreneurship.

## Program Structure

- **Twice-Yearly Batches**: YC runs two three-month programs every year, one in the winter (January to March) and one in the summer (June to August).
- **Funding**: Startups selected for the program receive seed funding, typically in exchange for a small equity stake (7% as of recent years).
- **Mentorship and Guidance**: Founders get access to an extensive network of mentors, including YC partners, alumni, and industry experts. They receive guidance on various aspects of building and scaling a startup.
- **Demo Day**: At the end of the three-month program, startups present their progress and future plans to a room full of investors during Demo Day. This event is a critical opportunity for startups to secure further investment.

- **Creating a Startup Culture**: YC has helped define the modern startup culture, emphasizing rapid iteration, scalability, and lean operations.
- **Promoting Diversity**: YC has made efforts to support underrepresented groups in tech, including women and minority founders.
- **Global Reach**: Although based in Silicon Valley, YC has a global impact, attracting startups from around the world and fostering a global network of entrepreneurs.
